                    <p>By visiting our site and/or ordering/purchasing something from us, you engage in our "Services”
                        and agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions (“Terms of Use”, “Terms”).

                        These Terms apply to all users of the site, including without limitation to those users who are
                        vendors, customers, merchants, and/or contributors of content.

                        We reserve the right to update, change or replace any part of these Terms. It is your
                        responsibility to check this page for any possible changes based on (but not restricted to) the
                        new government laws and/or the company’s policy changes.

                        If you continue using the website, it is considered as the whole acceptance of those
                        alterations.

                        By agreeing to these Terms, you represent that you are at least the age of 18 in your state or
                        province of residence. You may not use our products for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor
                        may you, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not
                        limited to copyright laws as well).

                        We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sale of our products or our Service
                        provision to any person of any geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on
                        a case-by-case basis.

                        We are not responsible if information made available on this site is not accurate, complete, or
                        current. We do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other
                        material purchased or obtained by you will meet your expectations, or that any errors in the
                        Service will be corrected.

                        We reserve the right to limit the quantity of any products or services that we offer. All
                        descriptions of products or products’ pricing are subject to change at any time without notice,
                        at the sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any
                        offer of any product or service made on this site is void where prohibited.

                        We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change,
                        suspension, or discontinuance of the Service provided.

                        We may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the website (including,
                        the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall also be subject
                        to these Terms.

                        These Terms of Use and any separate agreements whereby we provide you shall be governed by and
                        construed in accordance with the laws applicable.
